Pomodoro technique is a method of time management proposed by Francesco Cirillo on the 20th century. Consists in break any task in intervals, followed by short breaks. The original method uses intervals of 25 minutes, followed by short breaks of 5 minutes. [More info.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

**pomot** is an acronym of "Pomodoro Timer". It's a simple script to keep track of the pomodoro technique intervals. By the default, the working intervals are of 25 minutes and the short breaks of 8 minutes. Feel free to change the script to your own needs.

## Running
To run pomot, simply run the command ```./pomot```. Pomot depends on notify-send to work properly.
